## Project Info
My motivation for this project was to showcase my creative side. What I did for my project was go for a strong color selection to showcase a theme I wanted to go for. 

I used id tags on my (Home, Bio and Contact) to direct users throughout my web page. 

I added my profile picture to my website to show employers my personality. 

I also added music to my page to make my site interactive for users. I used my favoritte song because it is very inspirational to me. Here is the code  <audio controls>

    </audio>

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
